### :rocket: Get Started ###

1) Install Python 3.7 
2) Install the 3rdParties [FusionLDV](http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/Software/FUSION/fusionlatest.exe) and [LAStools](http://lastools.org/download/LAStools.zip) on its routes. 
3) Download or copy the repository.
Finally, execute the python code and select the directory of results, the point cloud and the shapefile. The last step is to introduce the distance of analysis in meters.
To test the software there are 2 files in the folder "example", a shapefile and a LAS file.
